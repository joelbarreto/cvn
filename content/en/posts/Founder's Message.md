One day, as I was thinking about what makes people happy, it struck me that people would be happy if they had all their necessities met. <span class="dark-blue f4">So, I asked an AI agent:</span>
> *what are the basic necesities for humans?*

<span class="dark-blue f4">This is what it told me:</span><!--more-->

> When we talk about basic necessities for humans, we're diving into the essentials that support life and well-being. Here’s a rundown:
> 
> 1. **Food and Water**: Adequate nutrition and hydration are crucial for survival and health. 
> 2. **Shelter**: Protection from the elements to provide safety and a sense of security.
> 3. **Clothing**: Depending on the climate, appropriate clothing is essential for protection and comfort.
> 4. **Healthcare**: Access to medical care, medications, and preventive services to maintain health.
> 5. **Sleep**: Rest is vital for physical and mental recovery.
> 6. **Social Connections**: Interacting with others for emotional support, companionship, and a sense of belonging.
> 7. **Education**: Learning opportunities to gain knowledge, skills, and personal development.
> 8. **Sanitation**: Clean water, waste management, and hygiene practices to prevent disease.
> 9. **Safety**: Feeling safe from physical harm, violence, and environmental hazards.
> 
> These are the fundamentals that underpin a healthy, happy, and stable life. Anything you'd like to explore further?

<span class="dark-blue f4">Then I asked myself - what can I do about this?</span>
There are lots of organizations focused on helping the poor and on the first 4 categories. And the last 3 are the focus of governments and large foundations. Money can address many of these necessities, **but 4,5 & 6 impacts everyone irrespective of income levels or age.** It struck me that I am at my unhappiest when I am *lonely* or I'm dealing with *health issues*. If this was true for me, then it is most likely the case for many others as well.

<span class="dark-green f3">At Caring Valley, we believe everyone has **Right to Happiness**</span>

Every human being deserves happiness and and a healthy mind is the foundation for lasting joy. We need *good health* and *meaningful social connections* to feel happy. Even if other necessities are lacking, these two alone can sustain happiness. Our survival instincts are phenomenal at keeping us alive, but they don't seem to kick in to make us happier.  **Happiness comes from the kindness of others—their compassion, gratitude, and love.** It’s through human connection that we truly thrive. 

This form's the basis of Caring Valley's mission.
