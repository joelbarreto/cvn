For years, I’ve thought about what truly makes people happier. Since happiness is a state of mind, it comes down to two possibilities—either people **don’t have worries**, or they **deeply believe there’s no need to worry**.

If someone doesn’t have worries, it likely means their basic needs are met—food, shelter, security. If they believe they don’t need to worry, they may have **faith in a higher power** or a **strong sense of trust in life**.

The more I reflected on this, the more I realized that <span class="green">happiness isn’t about wealth—it’s about health, mental well-being, and relationships</span>. The biggest causes of unhappiness tend to be <span class="red">poor health</span> and <span class="red">a lack of meaningful social connections</span> . At the end of the day, **other people** play the biggest role in shaping our happiness—positively and negatively. But even with strong relationships, nothing surpasses the impact of our physical and mental health.

And yet—despite knowing this—we often **take our health and relationships for granted**, chasing after things like wealth or influence instead. Maybe we’re wired that way. When we get sick, even briefly, our priorities shift—we focus on getting better, appreciating the support of those around us. But the moment we recover, we forget and return to competing for status or success. 

If happiness is truly our goal, maybe it’s time to **redefine what we value**. Imagine a world where **health and gratitude** were our currency instead of wealth or power. 

<span class="blue">I don’t know if I can change that, but what I do know is—I can **make someone happier today**.</span>

CARING VALLEY will be my vehicle for this journey.
