### Integrated Community Impact: Wisdom in STEM + ACSEF 2026

Through CVN’s partnership with local STEM organizations, supporters now have opportunities to actively participate in shaping student success. One key initiative is **volunteering as a judge for ACSEF 2026**, held on **Saturday, March 14, 2026, at Chabot College in Hayward**, where judges evaluate student STEM projects and participate in deliberations to determine awards. [<a class="link" href="https://www.acsef.org/judges">acsef.org ↗</a>]

This year’s fair anticipates **record student participation**, with projects spanning increasingly interdisciplinary fields. Professionals from **all backgrounds**—especially those in AI, software, computing, and biomedical domains—are encouraged to volunteer. No prior judging experience is required; clear guidelines and training sessions are provided to ensure volunteers feel confident and well-prepared.
