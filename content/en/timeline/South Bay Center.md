A suite in the Parkway Plaza complex on Great America Parkway in Santa Clara was selected to act as our South Bay community center. We were fortunate to find a very nice and central location which is well lit and uplifting in appearance. 

The initial work for setting up the center has begun and is expected to be completed by the end of Aug, 2025.
